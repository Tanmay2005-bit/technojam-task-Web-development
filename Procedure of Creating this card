In this project project I have created simple webpage featuring a card layout about mountains. Using Html tags , like setting width , assigning titles are done. Then linking of CSS sheets 
are done in order to make the card more presentable. The difficult portion here was adding the image , this is because the image should be in the same folder as in the as the other files
are interlinking cannot be done. Then simply other works are also done like giving headings and writing the content on the card. The main done here is done by CSS , by
making the font color black , length of the box , alligninng all the written work and seeting the background color. Card hover effect is also added by it in order to make card grow wider
when hover upon. Read more button is also added by it to make it more presentable.
