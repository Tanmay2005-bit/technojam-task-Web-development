My coding journey initially started in class 10th only learning to create simply webpages. Then I was to python in class 11th which makes my interest more in coding and helps me develop
basic logic. In class 12th it got more advance. I am always eager to learn and always eager to find solutions of the given problems. This is a small description about me in my new
journey I want to become a successfull software engineer and wants to create some impact in peoples lifes.
